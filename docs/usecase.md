Our topic is to solve the problem of searching through commands/scripts you have run/collected for a web browserâ€™s javascript console and python juypter notebooks.  All of our team members heavily use console/jupyter commands, and we had the idea of finding a better way to find that command we ran 5-10 commands ago or even further in the past. We all are working on a similar system, so we also want commands run by one individual to be searchable by others.
